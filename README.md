# design bootcamp

The design bootcamp is an online petition where visitors can sign to make their voice heard and vote for a new form of development to get extraordinary skills within the design field. It is a fully education program of 12 intense weeks in user experience and interface design. Participants will explore the professional areas of apps, websites, web design, software as well as other special gadgets you need today. After the program you will be able to create you own design concepts, create little products and put your creative ideas into action by designing interactive prototypes.

The project was made at the [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/de) within my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Nov. '21 to Feb. '22)

## Routes

### /about

By visiting the online plattform for the first time users will be redirected to an `/about` page where they will find general information that explains the issue and the context of the design bootcamp. There are two CTA buttons: the first one links to `/petition` page where to sign (provided the user is logged in); if the user is not logged in yet he will be redirected to the `/register` page. The second button links to the `/faq` page to read more about the design bootcamp.

### /register

The `/register` page renders a form to register for the online petition and create a new profile in the database. If the visitor has already registered he can easily get to the `/login` page by clicking the CTA button below. The password will be hashed with bcrypt so that a very high-level data protection is provided.
